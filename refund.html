        <h2>Effective Date: 03/05/2025</h2>
        <p>All memberships to The Militia Trading Company are recurring and billed automatically.</p>
        <h3>1. Subscription & Billing</h3>
        <p>â€¢ All memberships to The Militia Trading Company are recurring and billed automatically based
            on the subscription tier selected at the time of enrollment.
            â€¢ Payments are processed through third-party platforms (e.g., Patreon), and members are
            responsible for managing their subscriptions.</p>
        <h3>2. No-Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>â€¢ We maintain a strict no-refund policy on all memberships and digital content purchases.
            â€¢ Refunds will not be issued for unused time, dissatisfaction, failure to cancel, or any other
            reason unless explicitly approved in special circumstances (see Section 6).
            â€¢ By subscribing, you acknowledge and agree that all sales are final.</p>
        <h3>3. Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>â€¢ Members can cancel their subscription at any time through their respective payment provider
            (e.g., Patreon).
            â€¢ Cancellation stops future billing but does not provide a refund for the current billing cycle.
            Members will retain access until the end of their paid period.</p>
        <h3>4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h3>
        <p>â€¢ If a member initiates a chargeback or payment dispute, their access to The Militia Trading
            Company will be immediately revoked pending resolution.
            â€¢ Members who abuse chargebacks or fraudulently claim unauthorized charges will be
            permanently banned from our services.
            â€¢ If a chargeback is reversed in our favor, membership may be reinstated at our discretion.</p>
            <h3>5. Fraud Prevention & Abuse</h3>
        <p>â€¢ Any attempt to exploit our policies, including fraudulent refund requests, unauthorized access,
            or chargeback abuse, will result in an immediate ban from all Militia Trading Company
            services, including Discord access and future enrollments.
            â€¢ We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone attempting to abuse our platform.</p>
            <h3>6. Exceptions & Special Cases</h3>
        <p>â€¢ While refunds are generally not permitted, we may consider refund requests on a case-by-case
            basis under the following conditions:
            â€¢ Accidental double charges
            â€¢ Severe financial hardship (with reasonable proof)
            â€¢ Medical emergencies or extenuating circumstances
            â€¢ Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 7-10 business
            days.
            â€¢ The decision to grant a refund remains at the sole discretion of The Militia Trading Company.</p>
