        <h2>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</h2>

        <h3>🚀 1. Respect the Mission</h3>
        <p>We are here to focus, master, and build independence. Please avoid distractions, hype, and jumping between strategies. This server is grounded in our core principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One focused trading method</li>
            <li>Mastery over variety</li>
            <li>Zero tolerance for gimmicks, fads, or fearmongering</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🧠 2. Speak with Respect</h3>
        <p>Treat others how you want to be treated—like serious, focused people working toward freedom. Not allowed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Harassment, bullying, hate speech</li>
            <li>Personal attacks, sarcasm meant to belittle</li>
            <li>Arguments with moderators or staff (see section 6)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📵 3. No Spam, Scams, or Self-Promotion</h3>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promoting your own group, link, or service without approval</li>
            <li>DMing members unsolicited offers or advice</li>
            <li>Pump-and-dump schemes or shady affiliate links</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Violators will be banned—no questions asked.</p>

        <h3>💬 4. Use Channels as Intended</h3>
        <p>Help keep the server organized:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>#trading-talk – for technical and market discussions</li>
            <li>#general – for casual chat or quick questions</li>
            <li>#support – for help with access, billing, or platform issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're not sure where to post, ask a mod before you clutter up the server.</p>

        <h3>⚠️ 5. Stay Within the Law</h3>
        <p>This community is built on trust and transparency. That means:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>No impersonating other members or staff</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We report serious violations to Discord and, if needed, legal authorities.</p>

        <h3>🛡️ 6. Moderator Authority</h3>
        <p>Mods are here to keep the space focused and safe. Their word is final in the moment. If you disagree with a moderation decision:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not argue in public threads or chats</li>
            <li>Instead, DM a staff member or use the support channel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Repeat offenders or drama creators will be removed.</p>

        <h3>🔒 7. Keep It Private</h3>
        <p>Everything shared in this server should stay in the server. Do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screenshot and share private convos</li>
            <li>Copy, distribute, or repurpose educational materials without permission</li>
            <li>Leak server content externally—we take confidentiality seriously</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📚 8. Learn First, Then Ask</h3>
        <p>We encourage questions—but read pinned messages, guides, and past discussions first. This is a space for engaged learners, not passive consumers.</p>
