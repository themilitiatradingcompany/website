        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>At The Militia Trading Company, our mission is to empower individuals with a 
        sustainable future free from bosses, overlords, or overseers. We are committed to a 
        single, unwavering strategy—eliminating distractions, ignoring the noise, and 
        maintaining absolute focus on one clear goal. Through dedicated teaching and support, 
        we ensure that success comes from mastery, not mixed techniques or conflicting 
        approaches.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Core Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-Focused Strategy:</strong> We teach and support one proven approach—no mixing, no 
            distractions, no unnecessary complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Independence:</strong> Our goal is to help individuals break free from dependence 
            on employers or external control.</li>
            <li><strong>Mastery Over Variety:</strong> True success comes from mastering a single, effective method, 
            not jumping between strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Eliminating Noise:</strong> We cut through the hype, fads, and conflicting advice to keep our 
            community focused on what works.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Success:</strong> We prioritize sustainable results, not quick fixes or short-term 
            gimmicks.</li>
            <li><strong>Community & Support:</strong> We provide ongoing education and a like-minded network for 
            those committed to this path.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We trade with Precision. We profit with Strategy.</strong></p>
